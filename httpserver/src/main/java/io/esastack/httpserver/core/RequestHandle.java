 * When the {@link RequestHandle} is coming, current {@link Request} may have not been ended, which means the request
 * line and the request headers is coming and decoded as a instance of {@link RequestHandle} but the body(if present)
 * and trailing headers(if present) have not been received, and next you may want to handle them via {@link
 * #onData(Consumer)}, {@link #onTrailer(Consumer)}, {@link #onEnd(Function)}...
 * <p>
 * !Note: This class is not designed as thread-safe, please handing requests in current thread(probably the EventLoop),
 * because it is in unfinished state before calling {@link #onEnd(Function)} method, so you can use the {@link
 * #aggregated()} and {@link #multipart()} in {@link #onEnd(Function)} or use it after {@link #isEnded()} returns {@code
 * true}
